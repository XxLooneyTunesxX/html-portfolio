    <h1>Best Movies According to Mahra</h1>
        <h2>Top 3 Movies of all Time</h2><hr />
        
            <h3>A Cinderella Story</h3>
            <p>It's lighthearted, funny, and personally nostalgic. A cute romance.</p>

            <h3>White Chicks</h3>
            <p>I die of laughter every single time. Seriously funny stuff, and also nostalgic. Is there a pattern here?</p>

            <h3>The Greatest Showman</h3>
            <p>I love circuses, so this obviously makes the cut. I got weirdly emotional watching this for the first time, and then proceeded to watch it around 3 more times that year.</p>
